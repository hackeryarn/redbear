# Redbear

This was a quick test of an idea inspired by https://github.com/cgdeboer/blackbear.

`blackbear` shows that running many operations on small data sets can perform better in raw python than in the popular data science libraries. This inspired the theory that using the simplest conversion of types from Python to Rust would yield similar results.

Running tests with a few `blackbear` inspired functions proved the simple approach ends up not reaching any meaningful optimization. When running many operations on a small set, the performance was better than `polars` and `pandas`, but far behind `blackbear`. And when running on large sets the performance became very bad over all.
